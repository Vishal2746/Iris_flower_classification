Summary of Results:

1. Data Quality:
    
   -The Iris dataset has no missing values, and all features are numeric.
         
   -The data shows clear separations between different species based on their petal and sepal dimensions.

2. Model Performance:

   -Decision Tree, SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest all achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.
  
   -Cross-validation scores for all models are consistently high (~97%), indicating robust performance across different subsets of the data.
   
   -Feature importance analysis from the Decision Tree model indicates that petal dimensions are significantly more important for classification than sepal dimensions.

4. Feature Importance:

   -PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm are the most important features for distinguishing between the species.
  
   -SepalLengthCm and SepalWidthCm have much lower importance.
